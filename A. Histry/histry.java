Q. Why they named to Spring .?
	
	They are comparing Spring with EJB, EJB is like WINTER Season, and after winter the next coming season is SPRING.
	WINTER is not fine for US People because in Winter there used to get -20 Degree in America,
	so EJB they are comparing with Winter "season and the next "season is SPRING.
	In spring season they used to get 5-Degree or 0 degree thats fine for US people.

	No Resion behind it the are saying it Spring is EASY by comparing with EJB.

Spring is a Season, thats why we can see the Spring Logo i.e LEAF so just they are comparing with Season. no Resion behind it.

EJB is heavyweight because it has dependency with Application Server
