	What is Loosely Coupled .?
=================================

while building MVC based application or else.
Our application does not have any dependency with other Layer. 

in MVC, we can build DAO layer with any one by JDBC or Hibernate or JPA or iBaties 

so initially our Business layer are developed with DAO(JDBC), in future, if i want to move wth Hibernate, that compability
our business need to provide

If that compability we have then we can say Business Layer and DAO Layer are Loosely Coupled.
